# Survial-Gear-Selection 

A Python-based inventory management system for a zombie apocalypse survival game.  
It allows players to buy and manage essential items while balancing **weight and money** limits.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Zombie Apocalypse Store** - Players can buy weapons, medical kits, and survival gear  
✅ **Auto-Select Best Items** - Optimized selection for combat, utility, and survival  
✅ **Custom Inventory Management** - Players can manually pick items and track weight  
✅ **Fully Text-Based** - Works in **Google Colab** and **Local Python** environments  

## 🚀 How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Copy and paste the code from `inventory.py`
3. Run the script to display store items and auto-select the best inventory

## 💻 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Zombie-Survival-Inventory.git
   cd Zombie-Survival-Inventory
   ```
2. Install pandas (if not installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python inventory.py
   ```

## 📜 Example Output

## 🎮 Extra: Make It Interactive in Google Colab
If you want **manual selection instead of auto-picking**, replace this part:
```python
selected_items = [
    {"name": "Rusty Machete", "weight": 1.5, "cost": 200},
    {"name": "Handgun + 6 Bullets", "weight": 3, "cost": 500},
    {"name": "Backpack", "weight": 1, "cost": 100},
    {"name": "First Aid Kit", "weight": 2, "cost": 250},
]
```
With:
```python
selected_items = []
total_weight = 0
remaining_money = 900

while True:
    print("\nYour Current Inventory:")
    for item in selected_items:
        print(f"- {item['name']} ({item['weight']}kg) - {item['cost']} 💎")
    print(f"Total Weight: {total_weight}/15kg | Remaining Money: {remaining_money} 💎")

    item_name = input("\nEnter item name to buy (or type 'done' to finish): ").strip()
    if item_name.lower() == 'done':
        break
    
    found_item = next((item for item in items if item["name"].lower() == item_name.lower()), None)
    
    if found_item:
        if total_weight + found_item["weight"] <= 15 and remaining_money - found_item["cost"] >= 0:
            selected_items.append(found_item)
            total_weight += found_item["weight"]
            remaining_money -= found_item["cost"]
            print(f"✅ Added {found_item['name']} to your inventory!")
        else:
            print("⚠️ Not enough money or carrying capacity!")
    else:
        print("❌ Invalid item name! Please try again.")
```

## 🔥 Next Steps
- 🎮 Add more survival mechanics (thirst, fatigue)
- 🔥 Implement combat system (zombie encounters)
- 💾 Expand to save/load inventory feature
- 🌍 Create a full text-based RPG with events
